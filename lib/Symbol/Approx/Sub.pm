Symbol::Approx::Sub - Perl module for calling subroutines by approximate names!

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Symbol::Approx::Sub;

  sub a {
    # blah...
  }

  aa(); # executes a() if aa() doesn't exist.

  use Symbol::Approx::Sub (xform => 'Text::Metaphone');
  use Symbol::Approx::Sub (xform => undef,
                           match => 'String::Approx');
  use Symbol::Approx::Sub (xform => 'Text::Soundex');
  use Symbol::Approx::Sub (xform => \&my_transform);
  use Symbol::Approx::Sub (xform => [\&my_transform, 'Text::Soundex']);
  use Symbol::Approx::Sub (xform => \&my_transform,
                           match => \&my_matcher,
                           choose => \&my_chooser);


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is _really_ stupid. This module allows you to call subroutines by
_approximate_ names. Why you would ever want to do this is a complete
mystery to me. It was written as an experiment to see how well I
understood typeglobs and AUTOLOADing.

To use it, simply include the line:

  use Symbol::Approx::Sub;

somewhere in your program. Then, each time you call a subroutine that doesn't
exist in the the current package, Perl will search for a subroutine with
approximately the same name. The meaning of 'approximately the same' is
configurable. The default is to find subroutines with the same Soundex
value (as defined by Text::Soundex) as the missing subroutine. There are
two other built-in matching styles using Text::Metaphone and
String::Approx. To use either of these use:

  use Symbol::Approx::Sub (xform => 'Text::Metaphone');

or

  use Symbol::Approx::Sub (xform => undef,
                           match => 'String::Approx');

when using Symbol::Approx::Sub.

=head2 Configuring The Fuzzy Matching

There are three phases to the matching process. They are:

=over 4

=item *

B<transform> - a transform subroutine applies some kind of transformation
to the subroutine names. For example the default transformer applies the
Soundex algorithm to each of the subroutine names. Other obvious
tranformations would be to remove all the underscores or to change the
names to lower case.

A transform subroutine should simply apply its transformation to each
item in its parameter list and return the transformed list. For example, a
transformer that removed underscores from its parameters would look like
this:

  sub tranformer {
    map { s/_//g; $_ } @_;
  }

Transform subroutines can be chained together.

=item *

B<match> - a match subroutine takes a target string and a list of other
strings. It matches each of the strings against the target and determines
whether or not it 'matches' according to some criteria. For example, the
default matcher simply checks to see if the strings are equal.

A match subroutine is passed the target string as its first parameter,
followed by the list of potential matches. For each string that matches,
the matcher should return the index number from the input list. For example,
the default matcher is implemented like this:

  sub matcher {
    my ($sub, @subs) = @_;
    my (@ret);

    foreach (0 .. $#subs) {
      push @ret, $_ if $sub eq $subs[$_];
    }

    @ret;
  }

=item *

B<choose> - a chooser subroutine takes a list of matches and chooses exactly
one item from the list. The default matcher chooses one item at random.

A chooser subroutine is passed a list of matches and must simply return one
index number from that list. For example, the default chooser is implemented
like this:

  sub chooser {
    rand @_;
  }

=back

You can override any of these behaviours by writing your own transformer,
matcher or chooser. You can either define the subroutine in your own
script or you can put the subroutine in a separate module which
Symbol::Approx::Sub can then use as a I<plug-in>. See below for more details
on plug-ins.

To use your own function, simply pass a reference to the subroutine to the
C<use Symbol::Approx::Sub> line like this:

  use Symbol::Approx::Sub(xform => \&my_transform,
                          match => \&my_matcher,
                          choose => \&my_chooser);

A plug-in is simply a module that lives in the Symbol::Approx::Sub
namespace. For example, if you had a line of code like this:

  use Symbol::Approx::Sub(xform => 'MyTransform');

then Symbol::Approx::Sub will try to load a module called
Symbol::Approx::Sub::MyTransform and it will use a function from within that
module called C<transform> as the transform function. Similarly, the
matcher function is called C<match> and the chooser function is called
C<choose>.

The default transformer, matcher and chooser are available as plug-ins
called Text::Soundex, String::Equal and Random.

=head1 CAVEAT

I can't stress too strongly that this will make your code completely
unmaintainable and you really shouldn't use this module unless you're
doing something very stupid.

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

This idea came to me whilst sitting in Mark-Jason Dominus' "Tricks of
the Wizards" tutorial. In order to protect his reputation, I should
probably point out that just as the idea was forming in my head, he
clearly said that this kind of thing was a very bad idea.

Leon Brocard is clearly as mad as me as he pointed out some important bugs
and helped massively with the 'fuzzy-configurability'.

Matt Freake helped by pointing out that Perl generally does what you
mean, not what you think it should do.

Robin Houston spotted some nasty problems and (more importantly) supplied
patches.
