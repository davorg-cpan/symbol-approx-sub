<DESCRIPTION>
<SUBSECTION>
<HEAD>WHAT IS Symbol::Approx::Sub?</HEAD>

<TEXT>Symbol::Approx::Sub is a Perl module which allows you to call subroutines
using approximate names.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Of course, why you might want to do that is a completely different
question. You almost certainly don't want to do it in production
code as it will make your program almost completely unmaintainable.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I only wrote this module to test my understanding of typeglobs and
AUTOLOAD. I really don't expect it to have any sensible uses at all
(but if you find one, I'd be interested in knowing what it is).</TEXT>
</SUBSECTION>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEAD>HOW DO I INSTALL IT?</HEAD>

<TEXT>Symbol::Approx::Sub uses the standard Perl module architecture and can
therefore by installed using the standard Perl method which, in
brief, goes something like this:</TEXT>

<CODE>   gzip -cd Symbol-Approx-Sub-X.XX.tar.gz | tar xvf -
   cd Symbol-Approx-Sub-X.XX
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
</CODE>

<TEXT>Where X.XX is the version number of the module which you are 
installing.</TEXT>

<TEXT>If this doesn't work for you then creating a directory called 
Symbol/Approx somewhere in your Perl library path (@INC) and copying 
the Sub.pm file into this directory should also do the trick.</TEXT>
</SUBSECTION>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEAD>PREREQUISITES</HEAD>

<TEXT>As of version 1.03, Symbol::Approx::Sub uses Devel::Symdump to do 
all of the clever glob-walking stuff, so you'll need to get that from
CPAN and install it before installing Symbol::Approx::Sub.</TEXT>
</SUBSECTION>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEAD>WHERE IS THE DOCUMENTATION?</HEAD>

<TEXT>All of the documentation is currently in POD format in the Approx.pm
file. If you install the module using the standard method you should
be able to read it by typing</TEXT>

<CODE>   perldoc Symbol::Approx::Sub
</CODE>

<TEXT>at a comand prompt.</TEXT>
</SUBSECTION>

<SUBSECTION>
<HEAD>LATEST VERSION</HEAD>

<TEXT>The latest version of this module will always be available from
CPAN.</TEXT>
